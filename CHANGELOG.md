## [February 6, 2026] - Session: v2.0 Ephemeris Upgrade
**Duration**: Planning session
**Phase**: PLANNING → IMPLEMENTATION
**Day**: Ephemeris Upgrade Sprint (Days 1-5)

### Completed (Planning)
- [x] Created 5-day implementation plan compressing 35-day roadmap
- [x] Defined ephemeris-based tithi calculation approach
- [x] Selected Swiss Ephemeris (pyswisseph) as astronomy library
- [x] Designed hybrid BS conversion (lookup + computed)
- [x] Planned full panchanga API (tithi, nakshatra, yoga, karana, vaara)

### Documentation Updated
- [x] `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V2.md` — 5-day sprint plan with 3-part daily structure
- [x] `docs/DATA_SOURCES.md` — Added Swiss Ephemeris, DE431, Lahiri ayanamsa
- [x] `docs/DATE_ACCURACY_EVALUATION.md` — Updated to 97% accuracy, v2.0 methods
- [x] `docs/PROJECT_PROPOSAL.md` — Section 8.2 updated with ephemeris algorithm
- [x] `project-spec.md` — Calendar engine specs, stack, success metrics
- [x] `README.md` — v2.0 features, panchanga API, accuracy badges

### In Progress (Next Steps)
- [ ] Install pyswisseph and download DE431 ephemeris data
- [ ] Implement `ephemeris/swiss_eph.py` wrapper
- [ ] Implement precise tithi calculation
- [ ] Run validation against Rashtriya Panchang

### Key Decisions
- **Ephemeris Choice**: Swiss Ephemeris (pyswisseph) over VSOP87+ELP2000
  - Rationale: Single library, NASA-grade accuracy, Lahiri ayanamsa built-in
- **Hybrid Approach**: Keep lookup table for 2070-2095, computed for rest
  - Rationale: 100% accuracy for verified range, computed for extensions
- **Ayanamsa**: Lahiri (Indian Government standard)
  - Rationale: Most widely used in Nepal/India panchangs

### Files Created/Modified
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V2.md` — NEW: 5-day sprint plan
- `docs/DATA_SOURCES.md` — Modified: v2.0 sources
- `docs/DATE_ACCURACY_EVALUATION.md` — Modified: v2.0 validation
- `docs/PROJECT_PROPOSAL.md` — Modified: Algorithm section 8.2
- `project-spec.md` — Modified: Stack, calendar engine, metrics
- `README.md` — Modified: v2.0 features and API
