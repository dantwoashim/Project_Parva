# Year 3 Completion Report

## Status
Year 3 is now closed and operationally complete in this repository.

## Closed Tracks
- M25 Benchmark standard and reusable harness
- M26 Calibrated uncertainty modeling
- M27 Differential testing and drift gates
- M28 Long-horizon forecasting with confidence decay
- M29 Zero-cost scale architecture (precompute + cache)
- M30 Reliability engineering (SLOs + playbooks + degraded mode)
- M31 Security hardening baseline
- M32 Policy and compliance clarity
- M33 Deterministic explainability assistant
- M34 Institutional offline packaging and parity verification
- M35 v3 stabilization + LTS policy
- M36 Parva Temporal Spec 1.0 + conformance + reproducibility package

- v3 OpenAPI snapshot: `/Users/rohanbasnet14/Documents/Project Parva/docs/contracts/v3_openapi_snapshot.json`
- Institutional bundle outputs: `/Users/rohanbasnet14/Documents/Project Parva/output/offline/`
- Reproducibility package outputs: `/Users/rohanbasnet14/Documents/Project Parva/output/spec/`

## Final Validation Snapshot (Week 52)
- Full test suite: passing (`293 passed`)
- Frontend production build: passing
- v2 smoke checks: passing (`9/9`)
- Contract freeze check: passing
- Conformance suite: passing (`5/5`)
- Offline local parity verification: passing

## Program-Level Closeout
- Year 3 weekly execution is complete through Week 52.
- v3 is the stable contract line with migration and LTS policy published.
- Spec, benchmark, and conformance artifacts are sufficient for evaluator and institutional review.

## Next Horizon (Post-Year-3)
- Expand independent external replications of the conformance suite.
- Increase benchmark depth for additional calendar families and regional variants.
- Continue operational cadence for reliability/security release gates.
