# Year 3 Retrospective

## What worked
- Standardization-first execution (benchmark/spec/contracts) reduced drift risk.
- Explainability and provenance integration improved evaluator confidence.
- Precompute + cache strategy achieved free-tier-friendly performance.

## What was hard
- Balancing strict accuracy goals with heterogeneous source quality.
- Managing compatibility while introducing v3 LTS surfaces.
- Keeping docs and implementation synchronized across rapid iteration.

## Biggest outcomes
- v3 LTS routing track
- Deterministic reason traces
- Institutional offline packaging and parity tooling
- Spec 1.0 publication assets

## Next risks
- Long-term governance for rule changes and source disputes
- Scaling conformance datasets across more calendar families
- Continuous operations discipline for reliability/security gates
