# OCR Quality Report

- Parsed rows: **85**
- Mapped rows: **46**
- Mapping coverage (recall proxy): **54.12%**
- Mapping quality (precision proxy): **100.0%**

## Confidence Distribution

| Confidence | Count |
|---|---:|
| high | 45 |
| medium | 38 |
| low | 2 |
| unknown | 0 |

## Notes

- `precision_proxy` counts mapped rows with `high|medium` parse confidence.
- `recall_proxy` is mapped rows divided by total parsed rows.
- For strict precision/recall, attach a manually verified gold set in future iterations.
