# Year 3 Kickoff Plan

## Mission
Turn Parva from a strong platform into a published, reproducible standard for multi-calendar computation.

## Immediate Sprint (Weeks 97–100 Prep)
1. Establish benchmark schema + validator
2. Build first benchmark packs with citations
3. Run harness baseline against local API
4. Publish benchmark docs and reproducibility procedure

## Prep Completed Already
- Benchmark pack validator:
  - `/Users/rohanbasnet14/Documents/Project Parva/benchmark/validate_pack.py`
- Benchmark harness:
  - `/Users/rohanbasnet14/Documents/Project Parva/benchmark/harness.py`
- Seed packs:
  - `/Users/rohanbasnet14/Documents/Project Parva/benchmark/packs/bs_conversion_pack.json`
  - `/Users/rohanbasnet14/Documents/Project Parva/benchmark/packs/tithi_pack.json`

## Year 3 Priority Backlog (First 6 Weeks)
- Expand benchmark packs (BS/tithi/festival/multi-calendar)
- Add benchmark result comparison across snapshots
- Introduce uncertainty object design draft and calibration dataset inventory
- Add differential-testing adapters for external references
- Start Parva Temporal Spec draft structure

## Success Criteria for Kickoff
- Benchmark packs validate in CI
- Baseline harness report generated and stored
- All benchmark steps documented for external replication
