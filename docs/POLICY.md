# Policy & Usage

Project Parva outputs are provided for **informational use**.

## Core Policy
- API responses include `policy` metadata to communicate usage constraints.
- Dates are computational outputs with documented confidence/uncertainty semantics.
- For binding religious observance decisions, consult local panchang/authority.

## Metadata Contract
Default policy metadata:
- `usage`: `informational`
- `advisory`: short disclaimer for observance decisions
- `version`: policy version tag
- `disclaimer_url`: stable policy location

## Redistribution
- You may integrate and redistribute outputs under the repository license.
- Preserve attribution and confidence/provenance metadata where feasible.
