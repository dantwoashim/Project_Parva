# Three-Year Retrospective

## Journey Summary
Project Parva evolved from a proposal-stage festival app into a reproducible temporal infrastructure stack:
- Year 1: core computation correctness and API contracts
- Year 2: multi-calendar architecture, trust primitives, and ecosystem surfaces
- Year 3: standardization, explainability, reliability/security hardening, and packaging

## Core Moats Built
- Ephemeris-backed computations with explicit confidence modeling
- Provenance and Merkle proof workflows
- Deterministic explainability traces
- Public benchmark and conformance-ready artifacts
- Offline institutional package path

## Lessons
- Accuracy work is data-governance work, not just algorithm work.
- Versioned contracts and migration docs are as critical as code.
- Reproducibility requires tooling and packaging from day one.

## Future Direction
- Extend conformance and benchmark packs across additional calendar families
- Operationalize release gates in CI with stronger policy enforcement
- Community-governed rule revision workflow at scale
