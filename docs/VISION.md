# Vision

Project Parva aims to become trustworthy temporal infrastructure for Nepali festivals and calendrical computation.

## North star
A verifiable, open, API-first system that answers: "What is the correct date?"

## Product direction
1. Keep public API simple and stable (v3).
2. Keep engine correctness as primary value.
3. Expand practical user features (Personal Panchanga, Muhurta, Kundali).
4. Grow computed-rule coverage with evidence-based curation.
5. Keep deployment and operations sustainable on zero budget.

## What we avoid
1. Inflated claims without artifacts.
2. Version proliferation in public narrative.
3. Feature sprawl that weakens correctness.
