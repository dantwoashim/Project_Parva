## Evidence Artifacts
- Progress summary: `/Users/rohanbasnet14/Documents/Project Parva/docs/YEAR_2_PROGRESS.md`
- Retrospective: `/Users/rohanbasnet14/Documents/Project Parva/docs/YEAR_2_RETROSPECTIVE.md`
- Transparency docs: `/Users/rohanbasnet14/Documents/Project Parva/docs/TRANSPARENCY_LOG.md`
- Public beta metrics: `/Users/rohanbasnet14/Documents/Project Parva/docs/public_beta/dashboard_metrics.md`

## Final Validation Snapshot
- Full test suite: passing
- Plugin validation: passing
- V2 smoke checks: passing
- Frontend production build: passing

## Known Year-2 Constraints Carried Forward
- Chinese module currently confidence `approximate` in v1
- Tibetan and selected observance families need deeper benchmark packs
- SDK publishing automation to registries is not yet fully wired

## Handoff to Year 3
Year 3 starts from benchmark standardization and defensibility (M25 onward), with harness tooling now seeded in `/benchmark`.
