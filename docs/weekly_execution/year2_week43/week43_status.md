# Year 2 Week 43 Status (Plan Week 91)

## Completed
- Added optional anchor payload preparation and anchor record support:
  - `/Users/rohanbasnet14/Documents/Project Parva/backend/tools/transparency_anchor_prepare.py`
  - `/Users/rohanbasnet14/Documents/Project Parva/backend/app/provenance/routes.py`

## Outcome
