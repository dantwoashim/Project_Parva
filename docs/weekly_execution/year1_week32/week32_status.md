# Year 1 Week 32 Status (Evaluation Automation)

## Completed
- Added annual rerun pipeline script:
  - `/Users/rohanbasnet14/Documents/Project Parva/scripts/annual_rerun.sh`
- Pipeline now regenerates source normalization + OCR quality + evaluation outputs in one pass.
- Refreshed generated artifacts:
  - `/Users/rohanbasnet14/Documents/Project Parva/docs/SOURCE_COMPARISON.md`
  - `/Users/rohanbasnet14/Documents/Project Parva/docs/OCR_QUALITY_REPORT.md`
  - `/Users/rohanbasnet14/Documents/Project Parva/reports/evaluation_scorecard.md`

## Outcome
- Evaluation reruns are now reproducible with a single command and produce stable reporting artifacts.
