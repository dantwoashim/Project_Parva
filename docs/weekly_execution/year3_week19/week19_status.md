# Year 3 Week 19 Status (Plan Week 115)

## Completed
- Added cache-aware runtime paths to `/Users/rohanbasnet14/Documents/Project Parva/backend/app/calendar/routes.py` for panchanga + upcoming festivals.
- Built load simulation utility `/Users/rohanbasnet14/Documents/Project Parva/scripts/precompute/loadtest_cache.py` and generated `/Users/rohanbasnet14/Documents/Project Parva/reports/loadtest_m29.json`.

## Outcome
- Load/caching targets were exercised with strong cache-hit performance.
