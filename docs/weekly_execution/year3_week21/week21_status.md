## Completed
- Added reliability route surface `/Users/rohanbasnet14/Documents/Project Parva/backend/app/api/reliability_routes.py` (`/status`, `/slos`, `/playbooks`).
- Implemented runtime status and SLO evaluators in `/Users/rohanbasnet14/Documents/Project Parva/backend/app/reliability/status.py` and `/Users/rohanbasnet14/Documents/Project Parva/backend/app/reliability/slo.py`.

## Outcome
- Reliability visibility endpoints are now live and measurable.
