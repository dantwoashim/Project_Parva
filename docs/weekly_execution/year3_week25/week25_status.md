# Year 3 Week 25 Status (Plan Week 121)

## Completed
- Added request guard middleware to `/Users/rohanbasnet14/Documents/Project Parva/backend/app/main.py` for query/body size limits.
- Added security response headers (`nosniff`, `DENY`, `no-referrer`).

## Outcome
- Core API hardening controls now run on every request.
