# Known Limits

1. Regional observance jurisprudence can differ by tradition; API output is profile-based, not absolute religious authority.
2. Some festival entries remain provisional and rely on source curation before being promoted to fully computed status.
3. Very fine boundary cases near sunrise can vary when location/timezone inputs differ.
4. Personal Muhurta/Kundali outputs are informational and include policy advisories.
5. Public API profile is v3; experimental routes may change without compatibility guarantees.
6. Zero-budget hosting implies occasional cold-start latency on free tiers.
7. Authority Mode exposes computation metadata; it is not a legal or doctrinal certification layer.
8. Temporal Compass and ribbon views are optimized for modern browsers; older embedded webviews may degrade to basic card rendering.
9. Visual regression snapshots are deterministic fixtures, not live observational truth data.
